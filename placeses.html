        Step into the royal charm of Hawa Mahal, one of Jaipur’s <br>
        most iconic and photogenic landmarks. Built in 1799 by <br>
        Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, this five-story palace is <br>
        made of red and pink sandstone, standing tall in the <br>
        heart of the city. <br>
        With 953 small windows (jharokhas), Hawa Mahal was designed <br>
        for royal women to observe daily life and festivals without<br>
        being seen. The cool breeze passing through these windows <br>
        gave it the name “Palace of Winds.”<br>
        From its honeycomb structure to the intricate latticework <br>
        and elevated views of the old city, Hawa Mahal is a stunning <br>
        example of Rajput and Mughal architecture.<br>

       <h3>– The Astronomical Wonder of Jaipur</h3>
       Step into a world of science and history at Jantar Mantar, <br>
       Jaipur’s UNESCO World Heritage Site. Built in 1734 by the <br>
       scholarly king Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, this incredible<br>
       open-air observatory is a showcase of ancient astronomy.<br>

       It houses 19 giant instruments made of stone and marble, <br>
       designed to measure time, predict eclipses, track stars, <br>
       and observe planets — all with amazing accuracy, and without<br>
        modern technology.<br>

       The highlight is the Samrat Yantra, the world’s largest <br>
       stone sundial, which can tell the time with a precision <br>
       of just 2 seconds!<br>

       Whether you're a science lover or just curious, Jantar <br>
       Mantar offers a unique experience of how India’s ancient<br>
        astronomers read the skies.<br>

       <h3>–  Gateway to Spiritual Serenity</h3>
       Galta Gate is the grand entrance to the sacred Galta <br>
       Ji Temple, also known as the Monkey Temple of Jaipur.<br>
       Located on the eastern edge of the city, Galta Gate marks<br>
       the beginning of a peaceful journey into the hills, where <br>
       ancient temples, natural springs, and holy kunds <b> (water tanks)</b> 
       await.<br>

       Surrounded by Aravalli hills, the gate itself is built in<br>
       traditional Rajasthani style with a royal arch and stone<br>
       carvings, offering a majestic first impression before <br>
       entering the spiritual zone.<br>
       As you pass through Galta Gate, you step away from the<br>
       city's noise and into a sacred valley filled with devotion,<br>
       monkeys, panoramic views, and holy water believed to cleanse sins.<br>

       <h3>–  Jal Mahal – A Palace on Water</h3>
       GJal Mahal, meaning "Water Palace," is one of the most <br>
        mesmerizing architectural wonders in Jaipur, Rajasthan. <br>
        It sits quietly in the middle of Man Sagar Lake, appearing <br>
        to float on the serene waters. Surrounded by the majestic <br>
        Aravalli hills and a tranquil environment, this palace is <br>
        a symbol of Rajput elegance and engineering brilliance.<br>

      <b>History and Architecture</b><br>
       Jal Mahal was built in the 18th century by Maharaja Madho<br> 
       Singh I as a lodge for royal duck hunting trips. It was<br>
       never meant to be a palace for residence. Later, Maharaja<br>
       Jai Singh II made significant renovations, adding Mughal-style<br>
       gardens and features.<br>

       The palace is constructed in red sandstone and showcases a <br>
       beautiful blend of Rajput and Mughal architecture. It has <br>
       five floors, but during monsoon or when the lake is full, <br>
       four floors remain submerged underwater, giving it a magical <br>
       appearance.<br>
