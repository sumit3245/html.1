        Step into the royal charm of Hawa Mahal, one of Jaipur’s most iconic and photogenic landmarks. Built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, this five-story palace is made of red and pink sandstone, standing tall in the heart of the city.

With 953 small windows (jharokhas), Hawa Mahal was designed for royal women to observe daily life and festivals without being seen. The cool breeze passing through these windows gave it the name “Palace of Winds.”

From its honeycomb structure to the intricate latticework and elevated views of the old city, Hawa Mahal is a stunning example of Rajput and Mughal architecture.

       <h3>– The Astronomical Wonder of Jaipur</h3>
       Step into a world of science and history at Jantar Mantar, Jaipur’s UNESCO World Heritage Site. Built in 1734 by the scholarly king Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, this incredible open-air observatory is a showcase of ancient astronomy.

It houses 19 giant instruments made of stone and marble, designed to measure time, predict eclipses, track stars, and observe planets — all with amazing accuracy, and without modern technology.

The highlight is the Samrat Yantra, the world’s largest stone sundial, which can tell the time with a precision of just 2 seconds!

Whether you're a science lover or just curious, Jantar Mantar offers a unique experience of how India’s ancient astronomers read the skies.

       <h3>–  Gateway to Spiritual Serenity</h3>
       Galta Gate is the grand entrance to the sacred Galta Ji Temple, also known as the Monkey Temple of Jaipur. Located on the eastern edge of the city, Galta Gate marks the beginning of a peaceful journey into the hills, where ancient temples, natural springs, and holy kunds (water tanks) await.

Surrounded by Aravalli hills, the gate itself is built in traditional Rajasthani style with a royal arch and stone carvings, offering a majestic first impression before entering the spiritual zone.

As you pass through Galta Gate, you step away from the city's noise and into a sacred valley filled with devotion, monkeys, panoramic views, and holy water believed to cleanse sins.

       <h3>–  Jal Mahal – A Palace on Water</h3>
       GJal Mahal, meaning "Water Palace," is one of the most mesmerizing architectural wonders in Jaipur, Rajasthan. It sits quietly in the middle of Man Sagar Lake, appearing to float on the serene waters. Surrounded by the majestic Aravalli hills and a tranquil environment, this palace is a symbol of Rajput elegance and engineering brilliance.

       History and Architecture
       Jal Mahal was built in the 18th century by Maharaja Madho Singh I as a lodge for royal duck hunting trips. It was never meant to be a palace for residence. Later, Maharaja Jai Singh II made significant renovations, adding Mughal-style gardens and features.

       The palace is constructed in red sandstone and showcases a beautiful blend of Rajput and Mughal architecture. It has five floors, but during monsoon or when the lake is full, four floors remain submerged underwater, giving it a magical appearance.
