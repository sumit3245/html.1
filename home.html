      <center><h2> About Jaipur </h2>
      <p>
        Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, is one of India’s most culturally rich and visually stunning cities. Famously known as the Pink City, Jaipur got its nickname when the entire city was painted pink in 1876 to welcome the Prince of Wales. Today, it remains a symbol of royalty, heritage, and hospitality.

Founded in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, Jaipur is India's first planned city, designed according to ancient Indian Vastu Shastra. It is home to majestic forts, grand palaces, and bustling bazaars that reflect its glorious past. From the iconic Hawa Mahal and Amber Fort to the astronomical marvel Jantar Mantar and the elegant City Palace, every corner of Jaipur tells a story of royal legacy and architectural brilliance.

Jaipur is also a shopper’s paradise. Its colorful markets like Johari Bazaar, Tripolia Bazaar, and Bapu Bazaar offer traditional Rajasthani jewelry, handicrafts, textiles, and blue pottery. The local cuisine — from Dal Baati Churma to Ghewar — adds delicious flavor to your visit.

Whether you come for history, culture, food, or shopping, Jaipur offers an unforgettable experience. Surrounded by the Aravalli Hills and filled with vibrant festivals, warm people, and timeless charm, Jaipur is not just a destination — it's an emotion.
