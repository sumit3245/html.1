  History & Significance:
</h1>
Galta Ji has been a holy site for centuries. According <br>
to legend, the sage Rishi Galav lived and meditated <br>
here for many years. Pleased with his devotion, the<br>
gods caused a sacred stream to flow down from the <br>
Gaumukh (cow’s mouth-shaped rock), forming natural<br>
kunds.<br>

The temple complex was later built in the 18th century<br>
by Diwan Rao Kriparam, a courtier of Sawai Jai Singh<br>
II, the ruler of Jaipur.<br>
<h1>
   Monkeys at Galta Ji:
</h1>
Galta Ji is home to hundreds of monkeys, especially <br>
rhesus macaques. Visitors often feed them fruits and <br>
nuts, and they are generally harmless, though playful<br>
 and active. The monkeys are considered sacred and <br>
 symbolic of Lord Hanuman.<br>
